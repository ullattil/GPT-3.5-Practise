# GPT-3.5-Practise
This repository is where I practise using and testing OpenAI's API for GPT-3.5-Turbo (and GPT-4 Once I have access). Feel free to try out some of the code. There are comments before each new command and parameter to indicate what each one does. Any advise/new features that I have not used are much appreciated. 

Thank You.
